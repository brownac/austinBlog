    <h1>About this blog</h1>
    <h3>Instead of opting for something like Wordpress to document my everyday life, the developer in me wanted to build a blog form scratch.</h3>
    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">So that's exactly what I did.</h3>
    <p>This blog was built, deployed, and is maintained by me.</p>
    <p>From scratch.</p>
    <p>It was somewhat of an undertaking, but thankfully using a JavaScript framework (<a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor.js</a>) allowed for rapid and efficient development.</p>
    <p>My aim with this blog is to document my adventures this coming summer and beyond, and to talk a little bit about developer life and the ways that I try to challege myself every day.</p>
    <p>If you like the idea of doing this sort of thing, <a href="mailto:me@austincbrown.com">e-mail me</a> and we can chat! I love sharing my experiences and learning about other people's.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
